NNT2P Example Configuration

Please take a moment to read the following before making

    USER CONFIGURATION
    This section defines users that are allowed to connect to the
    cache. There are two types of user:

        CLIENT - This is a newsreader at the end user, you want to
        use this for regular users. These users will be able to
        retrieve articles from caches, as well as upstream servers
        configured later.

        CACHE - Use this account type for another NNTP2P cache
        instance. This user will only be able to retrieve content
        from the local cache.

    SERVER CONFIGURATION
    This section defines remote NNTP servers which the proxy can
    connect to and retrieve articles. There are three types:

        CACHE - This is another NNTP2P or other caching usenet
        proxy instance. If the inbuilt cache does not have an
        article, caches configured here will be preferred.

        PRIMARY - This is a regular NNTP server that you would
        normally connect to directly with your newsreader.

        BACKUP - The same as PRIMARY above, however will not be
        used unless an article cannot be found on any configured
        primary servers.

    Each configured cache has the following configuration options
    that should be configured appropriately:

        TYPE - The type of server, see explanation above.

        CONNECTIONS - The maximum number of connections to open
        to this server at any given time.

        HOST - The hostname or IP of the NNTP server to connect to

        PORT - The port of the NNTP server to connect to. Usually
        this is 563 for SSL connections or 119 otherwise.

        SSL - Whether or not to use SSL when connecting to the NNTP

    If the remote server does not require a username or password,
    these can be omitted as per the example below
